## **Project Title: TikTok Video Claim Prediction Model**

**Project Overview**

TikTok, a platform dedicated to inspiring creativity and bringing joy, faces the challenge of addressing a large number of user reports related to video content containing claims or opinions. To efficiently handle this influx of reports, TikTok aims to develop a predictive model that can identify whether a video contains a claim. Successful implementation of this model will not only reduce the backlog of user reports but also streamline the content moderation process.

**Task**

Data collection and preprocessing of video content reports.
Exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
Developing a predictive model to classify videos as containing claims or opinions.
Evaluating model performance through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Optimizing the model using GridSearchCV to fine-tune hyperparameters.

**Tools and Libraries**

Jupyter Notebook,
Python,
pandas,
numpy,
matplotlib,
seaborn,
CountVectorizer,
scikit-learn,
RandomForestClassifier,
XGBClassifier,
GridSearchCV

**Approach**

Data preprocessing, including text data cleaning and feature extraction.

Exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset

Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Model development, using both RandomForest and XGBoost classifiers.

Model evaluation, considering metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

This project aims to assist TikTok in efficiently managing user reports by automatically identifying videos that contain claims or opinions. Successful implementation of the predictive model will contribute to a smoother content moderation process on the platform.
